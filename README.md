# Building a Node.js Database using Prisma and SQLite

Prisma is a modern ORM (Object-Relational-Mapping tool) that works with Node.js and TypeScript.

SQLite is a self-contained database engine. This means that you don't need to configure a database on your computer.

## Requirements to build the project

- Node.js (12.2 or higher)

## Build and run the project

Run the database migrations:

```
$ npx prisma migrate dev
```

Run the project:

```
$ npm run dev
```
